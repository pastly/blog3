# blog3

This is the source of my blog.

It's currently located at https://blog.pastly.net.

Why blog3? Because this is the third static site generator I've used for the
same blog content.

## Directories

### hugo

The blog content in its markdown form, plus all the hugo stuff that makes it
look pretty.

### docker

Temporarily(?) failed experimentation.

I'm toying with putting my blog in a docker container and deploying it to THE
CLOUD https://fly.io. My work on this is in here.

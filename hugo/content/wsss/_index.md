I'm developing a proper Web Scale Static Site (WSSS) using State of My Art
(SOMA) technology (T).

Planned featured technologies:

[nix]: https://www.nba.com/knicks/
[rust]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust
[containers]: https://www.eveoncontainers.com/
[reproduce]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reproduction
[aws]: https://www.aws.org/home
[fly]: https://www.fly.com/
[first]: {{< ref conversion-to-scalability.md >}}
[wsss]: https://github.com/pastly/wsss

- [Nix][nix]
- [Rust][rust]
- [Containers][containers]
- [Reproduction][reproduce]
- Hosting with [fly][] or [aws][] or some other Web Scale Solution Source (WSSS)

Join me on this journey, and feel free to copy what you see into your projects.
If you have an existing static site you'd like to scale, take its output and
stuff it through [the second first post][first]. The code used throughout this series is [on github][wsss].

Stay tuned for the announcement of the first  Web Site Scalability Symposium
(WSSS).

I have two dogs, a fast car, and I'm currently obsessed with poker. Here's some
pictures before this turns into a proper resume.

I work for the Naval Research Lab. Since 2020 I've done things described by
these bullet points:

- Live network traffic analysis using Zeek and Suricata
- Ansible Automation Platform (Ansible Tower)
- Automating the application of DISA STIGs and SRGs

From both my work and personal life I have experience with the following
technologies:

- Redhat Enterprise Linux, FreeBSD, Debian
- Wireguard, Ansible, NGINX, Jenkins
- Python, Rust, C
- Docker, AWS

Best I can tell, I'm most known on the Internet for my association with Tor.
From 2016-2020 I worked among world experts on privacy and security performing
research and development on Tor, and sometimes the Internet in general. You
will find this reflected in my publications below.

I have managed 10s of Tor relays over the years, many of which are exits. At
times my fleet would push 1 Gbps 24/7/365 of usage (not capacity).  The
relays I run can be found [here][relays] <small>(link likely to stop working
without me noticing)</small>.

# Projects

In general, you can find code I write in public on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pastly) and
[Tor's GitLab](https://gitlab.torproject.org/pastly).

## Simple Bandwidth Scanner

[Project link](https://github.com/torproject/sbws)

Some of the Tor directory authorities run bandwidth scanners to measure the
bandwidth of relays and include their measurements in their network status
votes. Clients use the consensus of these weights to inform their path
selection process with the hope that every circuit they build will have roughly
equal performance, regardless of the relays chosen. This achieves a form of
load balancing.

Historically, the directory authorities that ran bandwidth scanners (bandwidth
authorities), ran [torflow](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torflow.git/).
Time passed, it slowly become less maintained, and
the collective knowledge of how it worked slipped away.

Simple Bandwidth Scanner (sbws) aims to be a quick to implement, easy to
maintain replacement for torflow.

## KIST

KIST is a new scheduler for Tor. It is merged into Tor code as of 0.3.2.9. It
prioritizes low-bandwidth, bursty traffic (web traffic) over high-bandwidth,
continuous traffic. See my relevant publications for more information.

## BM - Blog Maker

[Project link](https://github.com/pastly/bm)

BM is not maintained.

<!-- This blog-like website is created with bm. -->

BM is a set of scripts that use common GNU utilities to dynamically create a
static blog. See the README at the project page linked above for more
information.

## Ricochet

[Project link](https://github.com/pastly/ricochet/tree/group-messaging)

For my senior project, I worked on adding group chat to Ricochet. With the help
of my advisor, [Dr. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv), I
developed a set of protocols called Shrapnel that can be used for robust,
secure group messaging. 

The progress I made in implementing Shrapnel in Ricochet can be found
[here](https://github.com/pastly/ricochet/tree/group-messaging). I implemented
everything but

* handling chat history inconsistency
* handling group membership inconsistency
* everything GUI

## Movenseed

[Project link](https://github.com/pastly/movenseed)

Movenseed is a python3 script that's handy for continuing to seed files after
moving, renaming, and reorganizing them.

First you run the prework stage either on a directory containing the
correctly-organized files for seeding *or* a `.torrent` file. Then you stop
seeding while you do all the moving and reorganizing you want. Finally, you
run the postwork stage on the directories that have the renamed/reorganized
files in order to create symbolic links to them in the original directory. See
the README at the project page linked above for more information.

Generally speaking, this script is helpful in many instances of semi-manual
data deduplication.

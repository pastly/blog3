I made a thing.

<http://jptvwdeyknkv6oiwjtr2kxzehfnmcujl7rf7vytaikmwlvze773uiyyd.onion/>

<small>At various times, it used to be available at
jld3zkuo4b5mbios.onion,
vwx4mjvwoszgnagzcrwdjlsq3pq3zyob3zpq5qissxdoivnuyylzn7yd.onion,
onions.system33.pw, and
ypqmhx5z3q5o6beg.onion
</small>

Most of what I wanted to say about it I've already said at those links above.

It got picked up by Motherboard, and then a few other sites picked it up. This
was supposed to be a stupid little Saturday project. It isn't interesting. It
isn't exciting.

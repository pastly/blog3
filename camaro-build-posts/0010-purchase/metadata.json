It really looks like the car was left outside for 10-20 years and otherwise barely driven.\n\nEngine is shot. Transmission does shift into 1st and reverse (so I assume the rest too). But the plan is to swap in a better engine, a turbo, a built transmission, rear end, etc. and turn this into a proper race car.\n\nPictures from purchasing it 2/26/23 in Kansas City.",

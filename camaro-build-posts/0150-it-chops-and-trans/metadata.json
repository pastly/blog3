And related a pro tip: when you install your K member for \"the last time,\" try really hard to ensure it's square with the car. Find a way. Because if you don't, you'll get the engine and its accessories installed, then the transmission bolted to it, and you'll be trying to get the transmission mounted to its cross member only to find its off by half an inch. The whole gawd dang assembly is crooked."

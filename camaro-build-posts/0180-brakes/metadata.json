For example, I didn't even remember originally that the 9\" rear end came with brake lines, so I scrapped the plan to run hard line along the width of the rear end; the prudent thing to do would be to use the soft line and the T the rear end came with, even if the T is a silly blue color."

The line lock solenoid and the proportioning valve aren't actually mounted yet, but they are sitting where I think they'll go. They fit right in with the \"finished just enough to make it run\" theme."
